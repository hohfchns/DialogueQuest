# DialogueQuest - An easy dialogue system

# What is DialogueQuest?

DialogueQuest is a dialogue system (shocker!) for the Godot 4 game engine, that is designed with a few core principles:

- Collaboration - DialogueQuest is made with the vision of separating coders from scriptwriters.
- Simplicity - DialogueQuest does not try to be anything more than it needs to be.
- Stability - DialogueQuest keeps a limited scope in order to stay managable.
- Intuitivity - DialogueQuest always attempts to be easy to grasp and pick up quickly.
- Documentation - DialogueQuest keeps an up to date [user manual](docs/user_manual.pdf) and [developer manual](docs/developer_manual.pdf).

# What do I do??

Refer to the [User Manual](docs/user_manual.pdf) and [Developer Manual](docs/developer_manual.pdf).

The manuals cover everything from installation, to writing dialogue, and even extending the plugin to add your own functionality!

# DialogueQuest for non-coders

DialogueQuest features a standalone program called [DialogueQuestTester](https://github.com/hohfchns/DialogueQuestTester) that allows running dialogues without a Godot environment.

This is a core "feature" of DialogueQuest and the app will continuously be updated and improved to match DialogueQuest.
