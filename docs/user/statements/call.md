# The call statement

**This is advanced functionality, and requires coding knowledge to use**

The call statement allows you to run GDScript code directly from a DQD.

It's usage is:

```
call | [GDScript code]
```

Using call, you can run any GDScript code.

By default, this will run code as an `Expression` object.

DialogueQuest has a setting that runs the code in a GDScript instance, which is more powerful, however it is experimental.
