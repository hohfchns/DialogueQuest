# Exporting

When exporting your game, it is vital to include `.dqd` files in your build, as well as the plugin configuration file.

- Go to `Project -> Export`
- Select the platform you are exporting to (Linux/Windows/Web/etc.)
- Select the `Resources` tab
- Under `Filters to export non-resource files/folders`, add `*.dqd,*.conf`
