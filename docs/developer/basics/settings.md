# Settings

Settings are saved in the `.dialogue_quest_settings.conf` file.

When running from the Godot Editor, the settings will be decided by the Project Settings.

## Settings Options

- `data_directory`
  - The data directory is explained in the [data directory](#the-data-directory) section.
- `say_by_name`
  - If enabled, the `say` statement will be optional, and will automatically be used if the statment is a valid character ID. This may save time for writers, and is enabled by default.
