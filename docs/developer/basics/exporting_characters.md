# Exporting Characters


DialogueQuest allows for exporting your characters to files that can then be imported in DialogueQuestTester or another Godot project using DialogueQuest.

Exported DialogueQuest characters are saved in the `.dqc` format.

*Note - Exported characters are **not** Godot resources. Their only functionality is exporting and importing.*

To export, go to the `DialogueQuest` tab in the Godot editor, select your characters, and click `Export`. You will then be prompted for the directory to save the characters in.

To import, go to the `DialogueQuest` tab in the Godot editor, and press `Import`, then select all relevant `.dqc` character files.
