# Creating Characters

Before we starting creating dialogues, we need to know how to create characters.

Creating characters is quite simple, simply create a new `DQCharacter` Resource in your [Data Directory](#the-data-directory), and DialogueQuest will automatically be able to find and use it.

When creating a characters, you must provide a `character_id`. This is how the character will be referred to in [DQD](#writing-dialogue).
